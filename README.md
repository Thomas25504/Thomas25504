### 🙋🏼‍♂️ About Me  
I’m a 3rd-year Software Engineering student at Manchester Metropolitan University with a strong interest in full-stack development, clean architecture, and building efficient, user-focused applications.  
Outside of coding, I love running and going to the gym — anything that keeps me pushing limits.
